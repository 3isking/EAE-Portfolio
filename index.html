    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <span class="int">
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br/><br/>My name is Ace Malabanan, a Secondary 4 Student studying in Hougang Secondary School. I have experience in areas such as Game Development and Machine Learning through online courses. When I am away from school or a computer, I like to play guitar as well as board games with family and friends.</p>
        <p><strong>Ambition</strong><br/><br/>As technology advances, so does cybercrime. Cybercriminals are finding new ways to exploit the weaknesses in security systems for their own gain. I aspire to be able to defend the cyberspace from anyone who intends to abuse it. At the same time, I would like to be able to entertain others through video games made by me.</p>

        <p><strong>Leadership</strong><br/><br/>In school, I serve under the Executive Committee of the Student Council. I was in charge of the Communications Committee which takes care of matters such as student feedback. As one of the heads of the Student Council, I was able to lead a team in school events such as the Secondary 1 Orientation Camp. Aside from the Student Council, I act as the VIA Leader of the Basketball CCA, leading community projects such as gate painting or cleaning of HDB Flats.</p>

        <p><strong>100 Days of Code Challenge</strong><br/><br/>
        With the aim of developing coding habits, this challenge gets me to practice code an hour for a hundred days straight. Everyday, progress was being documented in an Instagram Account to help maintain the challenge as well as inspire others to develop their passion. Through this challenge, I was able to develop a daily routine, learn various areas of IT as well as communicate with others that are experienced in IT.</p>

        <p><strong>Online Workshops</strong><br/><br/>
            Through social media, online workshops are advertised and anyone of interest were able to sign up. These online workshops explore various areas in IT, ranging from game development to data analysis. Participants learn more about the field of IT as well as career paths. Afterwards, they get to write their own code as they follow the tutorial given by the instructors. These workshops allowed me to plan out my career path as well as further deepen my knowledge on IT.</p>

        <p><strong>Courses Through Sololearn</strong><br/><br/>
            As the internet rapidly evolves, it has become easy for anyone to learn coding in various ./Websites. Sololearn is a ./Website that gets people to learn a programming language through lessons and challenges. Its mobile support also allows learning to take place anywhere. Sololearn also has an active community that allows interaction and well as viewing code between people. Through this ./Website, I was able to learn the basics of various programming languages as well as interact with many others for guidance.</p>
